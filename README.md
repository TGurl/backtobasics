# Back to Basics

## A basic Skyblock

the idea is to return to the basics in skyblock. A starting island with noting but grass. You get a questbook at spawn and it will give you the starting items:
- bucket of lava
- ice
- 4 saplings
- 4 bread

You will need to create an old-fashioned cobblestone generator using crafting-tables.

# Pack Design

The quests will need to be playable on multi-player as I have my favorite youtubes HeatherTReneeB and TheModii101 in mind when creating this pack. Each player can then pick a questline, but both questlines must be completed to open up new questlines.

An example: Heather completes the basic questline and Modii does the questline for a mobspawner. They are dependend on each other as Heather creates the materials that Modii will need to do his. But Modii can then start creating wood as soon as Heather has completed the quest for saplings. This will be right at the start of her quest.

When the mobspawner is operational, it will provide materials for Heather to use in her questline.

When both questlines are completed the next 2 will open and they can continue.

The ultimate goal is to automate everything using Thermal, EnderIO, Refined Storage etc. As they will need more materials as the pack progresses. And to eliviate the grind automation is key. For example: to process iron it is best to automate crafting in RS, something I never see them do in packs. It will be key in this pack though. Using Mekanism we can go up to 5x doubling. Using a cobblegenerator, crushers and the lot ore processing will be automated and they shouldn't fall into a grind.

# Quest Book

There are 3 quest books systems available: Hardcore Questing, Better Questing and FTB quests. For now I will choose Better Questing as it gives the most and easiest way to create quests and rewards.

The rewards will be such that it might not be obvious why they got a certain reward but up to 4 steps further they can actually use the reward given. Up until a garden is available food rewards are also possible. I will also include choice rewards but with 2 choices or a reward bag. There will only be 2 choices so both can choose which one to get.

Reward bags will be designed that they can always be of use somewhere in the pack. No pesky rewards you will never use. It might be glass but hey, when making a Tinkers Smeltery you can use glass, but that questline is not visible yet.

# Recipes

Some recipes will be changed to make it so that they need each other to complete quests. For example: an iron furnace needs shards from EnderIO. Heather needs Modii to make the shards so she can craft a furnace. When she can't do that she can do something else until Modii has completed the quest for the shards. But it is in Modii's best interest to complete it as he needs the furnace for a questline. An example: the crusher from Thermal needs a furnace as an ingredient.
